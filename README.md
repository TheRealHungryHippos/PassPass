# PassPass

Pass Pass is a digital marketplace to allow ClassPass users to sell extra passes. 

Users can post:
* Number of passes they have available for sale 
* Price per pass
* Date range passes are valid
* Excluded studio locations, where they have already used their membership, as ClassPass restricts visits to the same studio per subscription month

Users can browse other userâ€™s passes for sale, and filter by those same criteria; buyers can contact sellers by email to discuss the purchase.

## Usage

### App
https://hungryhippopasspass.herokuapp.com/

## Requirements

- Node 6.11.x
- npm 3.10.x
- MySQL 5.7

## Development

### Installing Dependencies
Fork and clone the repo. From within the root directory:
https://github.com/TheRealHungryHippos/PassPass

```sh
npm install
```

Add `facebook.config.js` file for facebook session keys, use `facebook.example.config.js` as a template.
Add `session.config.js` file for session encryption key, use `session.example.config.js` as a template.
Install the database by running the `schema.sql` file with instructions at the top of that file

Launch webpack with `npm run react-dev`.
Launch the server with `npm run server-dev`.
Go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in your browser to run locally
If you need to change the port, do that in the server/index.js file at the bottom

### Testing

Tests are done with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html). Other packages used:
- [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)
- [React Test Utilities](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html)

Run tests in repo root folder with
```sh
npm test
```

Test results will be output to the terminal window.

Tests are split into 3 folders: react-client, server, and database, to match the equivalent folders with JavaScript source code.

Checking test coverage is TBD.

## Deployment
To deploy on Heroku:

Add ClearDB's addon, use the free ignite database. This will automatically add a `CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL` config variable. This is in the format of: 

`mysql://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/<database name>?reconnect=true`

To add the schema to ClearDB, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
mysql -h <hostname> -u <username> -p <database name> < schema.sql
```
it will then prompt you for your password. You can log in to your data base by running only `mysql -h <hostname> -u <username> -p <database name>`. You will have to `use <database name>` after logging in. **Note** this means your database name is different than you may be using in your `schema.sql` for local development.

Additional config variables to be set are:
- FB_CALLBACKURL
- FB_CLIENTID
- FB_CLIENTSECRET
- SESSION_SECRET

These replace the two config files used for local develpoment, `facebook.config.js` and `session.config.js`. 

Set config variables for both production and staging parts of your heroku pipeline. Review Apps will inherit config vars from your chosen app, but the `app.json` in your root folder must specify that these variables are to be inherited. To do so, mark those variables are required, but do not provide in `app.json`.
